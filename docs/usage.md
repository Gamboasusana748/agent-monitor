# Using Agent Monitor


Use the **Theme** selector in the top bar to choose **Green** (default), **Charcoal**, or **Light**. The choice is saved locally and restored on the next launch. Sidebar rows and section titles use text without decorative icons. Theme, provider, and run pickers use custom keyboard-accessible menus.

Use **Expand trace** or **Open trace in tab** in the details panel to read entries across the full window. Trace tabs use conversation cards with collapsible thinking and tool groups. Tool inputs and results are paired by their call IDs, including interleaved results; unmatched outputs remain visible. Search and event-kind filters keep matching conversation context together. Consecutive cumulative thinking summaries collapse into one block with an update count. Refresh reloads the recent entries, and the Graph tab returns to the canvas.

## Token usage and cost estimates

The sidebar shows combined input/output totals for loaded runs. Click the graph's token totals to open a per-agent breakdown, aggregated IN/OUT totals, a tokens-per-minute chart, and cumulative usage. Live counters use rolling digits and respect reduced-motion settings.

USD values use verified per-model API rates, including available cache and context-tier metadata. They are API-equivalent estimates, not subscription bills. Unknown models or incomplete usage remain unpriced and are disclosed in the breakdown. See [pricing sources and assumptions](token-pricing.md).
